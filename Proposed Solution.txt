Proposed Solution
⚫ AI-Powered Train Traffic Control System: An intelligent platform combining optimization algorithms and AI to dynamically manage train precedence, minimize delays, and maximize throughput on railway sections.
⚫ Conflict Detection Module: Automated detection of scheduling conflicts such as track overlaps, platform double-bookings, and junction conflicts through Python scripting and data parsing.
⚫ Optimization Engine: Uses advanced constraint programming (OR-Tools CP-SAT) to adjust train schedules by prioritizing express trains, ensuring safety margins, and minimizing total delay.
⚫ Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly React-based interface displaying before-and-after schedule visualizations, key performance indicators (KPIs) like total delay and throughput, and real-time re-optimization controls.
⚫ What-If Simulation Sandbox: Enables section controllers to test different scenarios, such as holding trains or rerouting, and observe their impact on overall traffic flow and punctuality.
⚫ ML-Based Prediction Module: Incorporates machine learning models to forecast estimated time of arrival (ETA) shifts, aiding better decision-making under disruptions.
⚫ Rule-Based Advisory System: Provides real-time speed recommendations based on signalling data, enhancing safety and smooth traffic movement.
⚫ Comprehensive Reporting & Audit Trails: Detailed logs and performance dashboards support continuous monitoring and iterative improvement of train traffic management.

This solution is designed to transform traditional manual train control into a precise, scalable, and responsive AI-driven system, improving efficiency and safety in congested rail networks.
